 Hey. I'm crisps56 (or Crispy.) I'm decent in some specfic coding languages such as: (Python, LUA "roblox lua and lua itself", C, C#, Java, Batch, HTML,  CSS, and PHP.)
 I'm new to GitHub, and I'm still exploring. I will post some of my projects on here, and make a few using GitHub.

 My socials and extra things will be added to my profile soon. Stay tuned.
 Thanks for reading my description. This will be updated once in a while just to keep things correct and add a few more things.
 Have a great day. ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ‘‹
